                    <p>When the night has come,</p>
                    <p>And the land is dark,</p>
                    <p>And the moon is the only light we'll see.</p>
                    <p>No, I won't be afraid,</p>
                    <p>Oh, I won't be afraid,</p>
                    <p>Just as long as you stand, stand by me.</p>
                    <p>So darling, darling, stand by me,</p>
                    <p>Oh, stand by me.</p>
                    <p>Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me.</p>
